## Summary
Humanity discovered "Faster Than light travel" thus came forth the invention of Gates which allowed humanity to travel to galaxies and worlds. These Gates were the only safest and fastest way to reach anywhere, suddenly without warning all of the Gate Systems went dead. Referred to in-game as "The Collapse". Without means of communication, war broke out. Fast Foward to roughly 206 years later and you venture out as a captain with a small crew to lead your way in this "Galactic Dark Age". Oddly in this technological dark age humanity can't build anything new due to copyright laws. That is explained in-game. During the Collapse everyone broke off into factions, each cannot and will not attempt to unify with others although you can incite peace through peace treaties, to which you can betray them and obliterate their main colonies because they don't have any more valuable resources to offer. There are 9 factions whom you'll see in every playthrough that you can pledge yourself to, forever be enemies with or be completely neutral with: The Hegemony who's the Galatic space police, The Persean League who hated taxes and broke off from the Hegemony, The Diktat who also hated taxes but are heavily militarized but massively produce fuel, Tri-Tachyon who are heavily advanced in Technology mass-produce unregulated AI cores for the highest bidder, The Ludduc Path are space terrorists hated by everyone but hates everyone as well, Pirates are also everyone's enemy especially you, The Luddic Church who believe the cause of all this war is from Tri-Tachyon's AI cores, The Independent are mercenary groups and finally the Human Domain who're junk rats. It is up to you to choose your path and remember that in space no one can hear you scream except ALPHA AI cores.   
    


## Final Thoughts
What I love about this sandbox space game is that you can do whatever you want so as long as you know what you are doing. The AI is rather impressive so is the pathfinding especially during space combat as its fluid and not generic as some may think. The artwork will remind you of Star Wars and isn't a hindrance to the player, the vast variety of ships, weapons and items you can use is near infinite. The downside is that sometimes micromanaging after at least 20-30 minutes can be a hassle and this could lead to boredom for the player even those who are dead set on bloodshed or causing chaos, some may argue this adds realism. Another problem is the FLUX system which is overheating your ship, sometimes the space battles you get into can get distracting thus leading to your death as your ship is offline due to not taking care of your FLUX. A final problem is that not all ships can use the same weapons although this adds variety because with this amount of ships in-game and weapons the game encourages you to try out new combos. So overall think of Starsector as the baby brother to Star Wars if Star Wars was heavily focused on the space aspect minus the fact that AI cores CAN turn against you. A final note being the game is always getting updated, even more content is thrown in by the modding commnuity and if the developers think its a great mod you can find that certain mod in-game which is very impressive.
